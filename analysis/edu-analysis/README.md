## Objectives

#### Primary Objectives

In this analysis, colony images where the colony possesses a free boundary to be quantified. The value of interest is the distance from the boundary from which the colony is growing. This is to explain the size of the subclones that occupy this zone.

We wanted to investigate the cause of unequal expansion of these subclones at early labeling times. Lineage traced cells increase their clone size through division of labeled progeny. Therefore, assessment of the proliferative status was key to understanding the dynamics of growth.
