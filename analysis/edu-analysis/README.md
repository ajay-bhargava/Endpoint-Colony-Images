## Objectives

#### Primary Objectives



From the last analysis, I demonstrated that the unequal expansion of subclones takes place at the boundary, but not at the interior of the colony. To investigate why this is, I did some EdU labeling, which then demonstrated that the number of EdU cells at the periphery is larger than that at the interior. Importantly also, cells proximal to a boundary also lose their proliferative potential due to a constraint imposed there. Furthermore, along the growth zone for the unbounded portion of the colony, the distance of unbounded cells to that boundary is a particular *distance* , and may even be the same for most large colonies.

Given the spatiotemporal dynamics of EdU during colony expansion, FUCCI sensors were installed into KPCre cells to dynamically track changes in proliferative potential during growth   

We wanted to investigate the cause of unequal expansion of these subclones at early labeling times. Lineage traced cells increase their clone size through division of labeled progeny. Therefore, assessment of the proliferative status was key to understanding the dynamics of growth. To ensure that only growth zones quantified were the places where the borderline was not against a hard boundary, data quantification was chosen at a place where the boundary faced the open environment.

Things to point out:

- Smaller colonies had growth along all distances of the boundary (X = Distance from boundary with V-Line indicating colony size, Y = Position of EdU object) and larger colonies had growth only at the periphery <- this is for data qualified on colonies that were unbounded.

- The density of the EdU +'ve cells for every distance within the growth zone also should be noted.

- Transitiion to how the system goes from EdU rich to EdU poor was quantified dynamically using a FUCCI sensor.

- FUCCI analysis start
