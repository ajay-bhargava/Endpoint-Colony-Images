## Size Distribution Analysis for Labeling Days

This is just to showcase that the clone sizes in 2D conform broadly to those in 3D, suggesting that both boundary driven growth and imposing boundary conditions (2D: Well, 3D: Maintaining force balance without causing distension)

### Notes

#### Folding observations

<!-- Not yet! : Due to the proximity of labeling within groups observed, labeling relationships are paired thusly (15, 18) ==> DAY 3,  (12, 09) ==> DAY 10, (06, 03) ==> DAY 15 -->
