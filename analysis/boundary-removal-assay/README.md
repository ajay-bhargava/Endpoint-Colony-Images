EXP073_simple_mixing_of_clones_to_boundary_then_removal
==============================

The purpose of the experiment is to determine whether the same form of clonal patterning would exist if 100 cells were seeded together in a confined environment vs a single cell that grows to a constraint. I later figured out that the removal of the boundary following mixing of clones was allowing the cells to undergo neutral evolution after the fact. This serves as the basis for EXP083.

Proper Experimental Setup
-------------------------

Make sure that the amount of volume inside the silicone circle does not exceed 500 microliters. Furthermore, do not deposit additional media outside the chamber until cells have finished competing within the chamber. The reason for this is to prevent any unwanted growth in the neutral evolution space before darwinian evolution takes place.

Scale Bars for representative images

They are at 1000um


Lingering questions
-------------------

If +1/2 topological defects govern extrusion of cells then why do Mad2 cells extrude more than non-Mad2 cells? Are Mad2 cells organizing themselves in nematic domains more than non-mad2 cells? What is the shape of the organization?
